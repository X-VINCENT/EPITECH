<p>Our game is simple, you play a rat in a city and your goal is to steal as many valuables items as possible !</p>

<p>For starters we advise you to steal some Knackis that are on the street in order to win some exp and upgrade your talents !</br >
Then you could go to some shops but beware of guards !</br >
When you feel ready you could go to the museum and try to steal the famous Mona Lisa !</br >
But be carefull ! If your money is under 0 you will automatically loose because of your debts !</br >
However if you manage to collect more than one million you will spend the rest of your life in a paradise island !</p>

Some infos about the game :
- You can change many options such as controls, sounds, window size, fps, etc ...
- You can save your game at the bed in your appartment
- You can change skin in your appartment at the top left corner
- You win exp by picking and selling items, and by winning fights
- Some objects are illegal (your job to find out which) if you go near a guard at the museum with one of them a fight will automatically start
- You can press H to see the radius of the detection range for guard
- You win money by selling items at the rat bar (the not good looking building in the bottom left size of the map)
- You can buy bombs to help you in fight and medkit to heal you between fights
